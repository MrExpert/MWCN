== 4.1 : Introducing the IDB Promised Library 

* When a user opens wittr, we want to start by showing the latest posts the device received, *before* going to the network.
* We make a *web socket* connection and we start receiving new posts one by one. 
* When we receive these posts, we want to display them, but we also want to add them to the set of posts we already have stored. 
* We also want to remove entries that are too old to be worth keeping. 

=== Introducing Databases
Databases are great for adding and removing individual posts, iterate over them, and query the data.

The web platform has a database called *IndexedDB*. We will be learning with that for the offline database approach. 
If we've used *noSQL* before, indexeddb will be familiar. If we've used relational databases before, then this will be a little weird. 

IDB can have many different databases with any name we give them, but we'll only be creating one for this lesson. 

* It's best to only have *one database per app*.
* The one data will have multiple objects stores, generally one for each kind of thing you want to store. 
* The object store contains multiple values. 
* The values can be JavaScript objects, strings, numbers, dates, or arrays.
* The items in the object's store can have a separate primary key or you can assign a property of the values to be the key.

Example: 

|===
| Out-of-line Keys | | In-line Keys
| *Key* | *Value* | *Entries* 
| Jane | 41 | {name: 'Jane', age: 41}
| Natalie | 24 | {name: 'Natalie', age: 24}
| Pete | 32 | {name: 'Pete', age: 32} 
|===

* The key must be unique within an object store because it is the way to identify a particular object.
* Later we can get, set, add, remove, iterate over items in object stores as part of a transaction.
* All read or write operations in indexDB must be part of a transaction.

Transaction: 

Here's an example of a series of steps:
* [ ] Add "hello:world" to *"keyval'* store.
* [ ] Get the first value from the *"people"* store 
* [ ] Change the person's name to "james"
* [ ] Wwrite it back to the *"people"* store.

If one of these steps fail, none of them will be applied. The state of the database would be 
as if none of the steps happened. 

''''

We can also create indexes *within* an object store, which provides a different view of the same 
data ordered by particular properties. 


|===
| People Store | ...indexed by age
| Entries | Entries 
| {name: 'Jane', age 41} | {age: 24, name: 'Natalie'}
| {name: 'Natalie', age: 24} | {age: 32, name: 'Pete'}
| {name: 'Pete', age: 32} | {age: 41, name: 'Jane'} 
|===

Example here is similar to a lot of databases which makes a lot of sense. The browser support 
is good as well with every major browser supporting it. 

=== IndexedDB's bad reputation

The API for IDB is horrid, and creates spaghetti code. 
Though it is *asynchronous* which is fine, but it predates promises. It created its own *event-based promise* system which creates really 
confusing code.  

The instructor says he's going to chicken out of teaching us the IDB's API. So instead 
we're going to use *IndexDB Promised*. link:https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb/blob/master/README.md[]

It's a small library that mirrors the *IndexDB API*, but uses *promises* rather than events. Other than that 
it's the same as IndexedDB.

== 4.2 : Getting STarted with IDB 

First you head over to link:http://localhost:8888/idb-test/[] +
It should be a blank page. The script for *idb-test* is in *public > js > idb-test > index.js*

All that is in there is an import for the idb library that we saw before. 
----
import idb from 'idb';
----

=== Creating our database 

To create a database, we use 

----
idb.open(name, version, upgradeCallback)
----

idb.open() takes in 3 parameters: 

* name 
* version
* upgradeCallback - a callback to set the database up. 

=== Creating our Database START 

under the import, we create our database 

----
idb.open('test-db', 1, function(upgradeDb) {})


----

* The function will be called if the browser hasn't heard about this database before or if the version 
it knows about is less than this numbe here.

* The function uses the parameter *upgradeDb* which we use to define the database.

* To ensure the DB integrity, this is the *only* place we can create and remove object stores and indexes.

=== Creating an object store 

The original syntax for creating goes something like this:

----
var objectStore = db.createObjectStore("toDoList", { keyPath: "taskTitle" });
----

The original syntax for adding an item inside.

----
var request = objectStore.put(myItem, optionalKey);
----
NOTE: It is value, key instead of the usual key, value.

''''

For our project, we will create an object store called keyVal. This store has a key that's separate to the data and does this 
by default, which is what we want for a keyValStore.

----
var keyVal = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('keyval');
----

We want to add some content. 

In the library docs that an object store has methods which behave the same as IDB, except they return a promise. 
The library is way more usable than plain IDB.

----
keyValStore.put('world', 'hello')
----

* We finished setting up our database. *.open* returns a promise that resolves with a database object.
* Jake stored the database in the variable *dbPromise*. Now we can use that database object to get and set items in the database.

Here's how it would look like alltogether so far:
----
const dbPromise = idb.open('test-db', 1, (upgradeDb) => {
  const keyValStore = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('keyval');
  keyValStore.put("world", "hello");
  return;
}); 
----
and in dev tools the result should look like this: 

image:img/idb1.png[]

''''
=== Reading the Database
So now for *reading* the database! +

* we need to create a transaction. The function to do this 
is *db.transaction()* with the *keyval* object store. 
----
const tx = db.transaction('keyval');
----

* Then we call the object store (*keyValStore*), passing in the name of the object store I want, *keyval*.
----
const keyValStore = tx.objectStore('keyval')
----

NOTE: It may be repetitive, but there's a possibility that you'll have a transaction that uses multiple objects stores.

* we call .get() on the object store and pass the key I'm interested in such as "*hello*". 

----
return keyValStore.get('hello');
----

It will return a promise, which resolves to the value I'm looking for.

----
.then( val => console.log(`The value of "hello" is: ${val}`))

or 

.then(function(val) {
    console.log('The value of "hello" is:', val);
}
----

Here's how they look all together for reading the object store 

----
dbPromise.then(db => {
  const tx = db.transaction('keyval');
  const keyValStore = tx.objectStore('keyval');
  return keyValStore.get('hello');
}).then(val => console.log(`The value of "hello" is: ${val}`))
----

When you refresh in console in devtools, you should get: 

*The value of "hello" is: world*

''''
=== Adding another value to the object store 

Now if we want to add another value to the object store. To do that, we need to create 
a transaction just as we did before, but this time we specify that we want to *read and write* this time.

----
dbPromise.then(function(db) {
    var tx = db.transaction('keyval', 'readwrite' );
    var keyValStore = tx.objectStore('keyval');
    keyValStore.put('bar', 'foo');
}
----

when using *.put*, it returns a promise. This promise doesn't mean it will work. As a reminder, 
if any part of the operation fails, the whole operation will fail. Which is kind of a good thing because none of the 
operation will be in a half finished state. So either all happens or none of it happens. 

----
return tx.complete;
----

transaction.complete is a promise that filfills if and when the transaction completes, and it rejects if it fails.

Once the transaction completes, I'm going to log a success message: 

----
.then(function() {
    console.log('Added foo:bar to keyval')
})
----

Here's how they look like all together in an ES6 practice version. 

----
dbPromise.then(db => {
  const tx = db.transaction('keyval', 'readwrite');
  var keyValStore = tx.objectStore('keyval');
  keyValStore.put('bar', 'foo');
  return tx.complete;
}).then(_ => console.log(`Added foo:bar to keyval`));
----

and get this result in console: *Added foo:bar to keyval* and this in the idb database +

== 4.3 : Quiz: Getting Started with IDB 

You don't have to, but if you want to ready the template for the quiz, you can type in: +
----
git reset --hard 
git checkout page-skeleton
----

* Just in case you forget where the IDB index is for editing, it's in: + 
public > js > idb-test > index.js

* TODO: in the keyval store, set "favoriteAnimal" as the key and an animal as your value. eg: cat or dog. 

''''
Code Refresher: +
====
* Create a function for *dbPromise* with a *read and write* transaction. 
----
dbPromise.then(db => {
  const tx = db.transaction('keyval', 'readwrite');
})
----

* Then we have to have a place to store the information to.
----
const keyValStore = tx.objectStore('keyval');
----

* The process of actually adding the key and value. Don't forget to return the information.
----
keyValStore.put('animalOfChoice', 'favoriteAnimal');
return tx.complete;
----
====

* Once you've completed the task, check to see if the entry was submitted into the devtool's database. If you don't see it right away, try refreshing it.

NOTE: Make sure you're in localhost:8888/idb-test.

* Once you see the entry, head on over to the setting's page and type in test ID: *idb-animal* and you should see the message: *Yay! Your favorite animal is "animalYouPicked*


''''
The answer should have been: 

----
dbPromise.then(function(db) {
    const tx = db.transaction('keyval', 'readwrite');
    const keyvalStore = tx.objectStore('keyval');
    keyvalStore.put('manatee', 'favoriteAnimal');
    return tx.complete;
}).then(_ => console.log("added an animal"));
----

''''
==== Adding People objects to objectStore 

So far we've created a *key/value* objects store, but now we want to create a different 
store with objects all of the same kind. Such as *people*. To do that, we need to create another ObjectStore. 
To create a different objectstore, we need to do that in indexes within the upgrade function.

NOTE: You need to bump the version of the .open() for the upgradeDb function to run again for the new addition we're going to put in.

* We create a new objectStore called *People*. It's not going to have separate keys, instead the name property of 
the objects inside will be the key.

----
keyValStore.put('people', { keyPath: 'name'});
----

Here Jake mentions that in the real world, people will have the same name, but in this case, we're just going to assume people have different names.

WARNING: If we try to run the code now, it will fail because *createObjectStore* has already been created.

IDB has a workaround to that problem. +
Introducing: *oldVersion* in conjuction with link:https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp[switch()] statement to let you know which to run if a certain version. +
We use the switch and oldversion to surround each of the createObjectStore to control which ones to run when.

----
switch(upgradeDb.oldVersion) {
  case 0;
    var keyValStore = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('keyval');
    keyValStore.put("world", "hello");
  case 1;
    upgradeDb.createObjectStore('people', { keyPath: 'name'})
}
----

So if the version is 0, it sets up the 'keyval' store, if the version is 1, we set up the 'people' store.

NOTE: Usually with switch statements, there's a *break* after each case, but we don't want to do that here because if the browser hasn't 
set up this database at all before, it'll start with case 0. It will create the key object store, but it will continue and create the object store.

''''
=== Adding people to the People store.

* *Step 1* : Create the transaction for people and make it read/write.
----
dbPromise.then(function(db) {
  var tx = db.transaction('people', 'readwrite');
  var peopleStore = tx.objectStore('people');
})
----

* *Step 2* : Adding a person. Putting in their name, age, and their favorite animal.

----
peopleStore.put({
  name: 'Sam Munoz',
  age: 25,
  favoriteAnimal: 'dog'
}); 
return tx.complete
----

NOTE: we just put in *.put()* without a key this time. Because when we created the objectStore, we specified the key was { keyPath: 'name'}. So the *name* of the object is the key.

* *Step 3*: Now we can add a success console message. 

----
.then(function() {
  console.log('People added')
})
----

Here, Jake added a lot more people objects into the list...

=== Reading people in object store. 

We have to create a transaction for people again. 

* *Step 1* : We get ahold of the people object store with transaction again.
----
db.Promise.then(function(db) {
  var tx = db.transaction('people');
  var peopleStore = tx.objectStore('people')
})
----

* *Step 2* : We use *.getAll()* Which returns a promise for all the object in the store.

----
return peopleStore.getAll();
----

* *Step 3*: Then we log the information.

----
.then(function(people) {
  console.log('People:', people);
})
----

By default it will be sorted alphabetically by their name since that is the key.

=== Changing the sorting to their favorite animal.

This is where indexes come in. 
Indexes can only be created as part of a version upgrade and put inside the .open() function.

* *Step 1* : Bump the version number. 
* *Step 2* : Add an index to our switch case. 
* *Step 3* : First we need to get ahold of the *person* object store using transaction again.

----
case 2: 
  var peopleStore = upgradeDb.transaction.objectStore('people')
----

* *Step 4* : Now that we have the store, we have to create the index called *animal* which will sort by 'favoriteAnimal' property.

----
peopleStore.createIndex('animal', 'favoriteAnimal')
----

* *Step 5* : Now for actually using it. We go back to where we were reading *people* +
here's the original that we wrote: 
----
db.Promise.then(function(db) {
  var tx = db.transaction('people');
  var peopleStore = tx.objectStore('people');

  return peopleStore.getAll();
}).then(function(people) {
  console.log('People:', people);
})
----

* *Step 6* : first we create a new index from the object store by *animal*
----
var animalIndex = peopleStore.index('animal')
----

* *Step 7* : Then we modify *.get()*. Instead of returning peopleStore, we're returning *animalIndex*.

Now when we refresh the browser to see the changes, they're sorted by their favoriteAnimals.

=== How to execute queries on the index.

Using *.getAll()* you can put a specific key to search for. Such as *.getAll('cat')*.


== 4.4 : Quiz: More IDB 

This we need to get the same template as Jake's 

----
git reset --hard 
git checkout task-idb-people
----

* We need to create an index for *people* ordered by *age* inside the upgrade function.
* At the bottom of the code we need to log out all the people in that order. 

Code Refresher: 
====
This is kind of a spoiler, but I figured it was copying what you last did anyway.


* Add an index to the createObject function and use switch.
----
  case 3:
  var peopleStore = upgradeDb.transaction.objectStore('people'); // first access the people database.
  peopleStore.createIndex('age', 'age');  //Then create a new index (create the new name, the key that we'll sort with)
----

To read and console.log our result.
----
dbPromise.then(function(db) {
    var tx = db.transaction('people');
    var peopleStore = tx.objectStore('people'); // first access the people objectstore.

    var ageIndex = peopleStore.index('age'); // We also access the index we created earlier and we store it in ageIndex.
  
    return ageIndex.getAll();  // return what we stored in ageIndex.
  }).then(function(age) {
    console.log('age:', age);    // the logged info and sorted by age.
  });
----
====

NOTE: Be sure to change the version # and also, the *TODO:* in the createObject function was after the curly bracket. Your new created Index should be inside with the others.

* once done, we should see the changes in the browser's console and there will be *age* section in people's database.

* To confirm the changes, go to the setting's page and type in the test ID: *idb-age*. You should see the message *Yay! The age index is working*.

=== Introducing cursors
We've been getting items out of the store, but now we can go through them one at a time using cursors.


Using the age property that we created, instead of calling getAll(), we're going to *open a cursor*.
----
return ageIndex.openCursor();
----

That will return a promise for a cursor object representing the first item in the index or undefined if there isn't one. But if it 
is undefined, we're going to do a usual return. 

----
.then(function(cursor) {
  if {!cursor) return;
})
----

otherwise we'll just log it 

----
console.log('Cursored at:', cursor.value.name);
----

The first person in the index is in *cursor.value*.

Next we insert this code to move on to the next item.
----
return cursor.continue();
----
This returns a promise for a cursor representing the next item or undefined if there isn't one.

''''
=== Using cursor to keep going until undefined
Now if we want this to keep going until it becomes undefined, this is where it gets trickly.

*Step 1* : you can name the function we're in. 

-----
.then(function logPerson(cursor) {...})
-----

*Step 2* Then we can call it once cursor.continue resolves.

----
return cursor.continue().neth(logPerson);
---- 

What this does is that it creates an asynchronous loop until cursor is undefined which is the end of the list.

----
.then(function() {
  console.log('Done cursoring');
})
----


=== Skipping items with cursor. 

Let's say you want to skip the first two items, here is what you'd put. 
-----
.then(function(cursor) {
  if (!cursor) return;
  return cursor.advance(2);
})
-----

=== Cursor Summary
''''
So far it just shows a complicated way of using .getAll(), but cursors become really useful 
when you want to modify items as you're looping through. You can use your cursor to: +

* cursor.update(newValue) to change the value.
* cursor.delete() to remove it.

''''

This is the basics for what we'll be covering in the lesson. It's the basic API. 

If you want to play with the code that Jake was writing...

----
git reset --hard 
git checkout idb-cursoring

== 4.5 : Using the IDB Cache and Display Entries 

The objective is to create a database that stores the posts.

When wittr loads via a service worker, it does so without going to the network. It fetches the page skeleton and assets straight from the cache.

At the moment we have to go to the network for posts. We're going to change that. We want to get the posts from the offline stored database and display them. Then we want to connect the web socket to get updated posts once we're online. Web sockets bypass both the service worker and the http cache. As the new posts
arrive, we'll add them to our database for next time. 

* *Step 1* : We need to populate the database. First we need to inspect our websocket code. Head to public>js>main>inddexController.js
  . There is a method that is called to open the web socket. 
  ----
    this._openSocket();
  ----

  ----
  // open a connection to the server for live updates
IndexController.prototype._openSocket = function() {
  var indexController = this;
  var latestPostDate = this._postsView.getLatestPostDate();
  ----
  
In this methodd, we can see a listener for the message event.
